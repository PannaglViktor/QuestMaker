## 🌟 About the Project

QuestMaster is an Android application designed to bring a new level of excitement to organizing and sharing your real-world adventures.

The core idea is to transform any plan, big or small, into a **Quest** with defined objectives and a strong sense of shared purpose.

This project was born from the idea that life's most memorable moments often come from shared experiences and the stories we create together.  
QuestMaster aims to be the platform that facilitates those stories.
